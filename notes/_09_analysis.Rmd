# Introduction
In this lab we will introduce functions used for basic statistical analysis


### Student Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson students will be able to identify a handful of functions to perform statistical analysis techniques using R

**Note: This lesson does not cover the Statistical Methodology or theory behind these statistical procedures. This workshop assumes that you have checked model assumptions and have chosen the most appropriate model for the research question being analyzed. **

# Prepare for class

1. Download the `cdc` data from [this link](../data/cdc.txt) and store it in your class folder. 
    - Don't forget to right click and _save link as_. 
2. Download [this](day4-functions-for-analysis.Rmd) RMD file that was used to create this lesson. 
    - Prepare to write your own notes in it during class. There will be nothing to turn in. 
3. Install the `ggplot2` and `gridExtra` packages into R if you have not already done so. 
    - We will learn more how these functions work to create graphics next week. 


## About the Data 

The data comes from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), which has been conducting the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) since 1984. BRFSS is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The data we are using comes from a random sample of 20,000 participants from this survey. More information on the survey and data can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/

# In class

Setup your first code chunk to load libraries, set options, and read in the data. 

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
cdc <- read.table("../data/cdc.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
```


## Data Management / cleaning 

Let's create some variables that we'll analyze throughout this tutorial. 

The BEFSS asks participants how much they weigh, and how much they want to weigh. Let's create a difference between the two to measure whether the participants feel the are under, or overweight. 
**Create the variable `wtdiff` as `wtdesire` - `weight`, so a positive value means they want to gain weight.**
```{r}
cdc$wtdiff <- cdc$wtdesire - cdc$weight
```


## Simple Analysis
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Optional settings for cleaning up the resulting knitted document 
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,  
               fig.align = 'center',  fig.width=6, fig.height=4)

```

### One sample T-test for a mean

**Are people on average happy with their weight?**

1. Look at your data. Calculate summary statistics and a plot. 
```{r}
summary(cdc$wtdiff)
a <- ggplot(cdc, aes(x=wtdiff)) + geom_histogram() + theme_bw()
b <- ggplot(cdc, aes(x=1, y=wtdiff)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()
grid.arrange(a, b, nrow=1)
```

There are some people who report wanting to gain 300 and 500 lbs. Let's consider them outliers and remove them from our analyses by overwriting the `cdc` data set with a subset of rows, where `wtdiff` is less than 200.  

```{r}
cdc <- subset(cdc, wtdiff < 200)
```


2. Use a 1-sample T(Z)-test for no difference (`wtdiff` = 0)
```{r}
t.test(cdc$wtdiff, mu=0, alternative="two.sided", conf.level = .95)
```

On average people want to weigh 14.6 (95% CI 14.3 to 15) lbs less than they do now. 

### One sample test for a proportion

**What is the proportion of survey participants who have smoked in the past 100 days?**

1. Look at your data. Calculate frequency and percent tables. 
```{r}
table(cdc$smoke100)
prop.table(table(cdc$smoke100))
```

2. Conduct a 1-sample test of proportions to see if less than half of the participants smoke. 
```{r}
prop.test(x=9440, n=19998, p=.5)
```

Significantly less than half 9440 (47%) of survey participants reported smoking in the past 100 days. 

_Since `smoke100` is treated by R to be a numeric variable, we can utilize the theoretical property that a proportion is a mean of a binary variable and use a `t.test()`._

```{r}
t.test(cdc$smoke100, mu=.5)
```

### Two sample t-test for a difference in means

**Do males and females have different perceptions on their weight**

1. Look at the data by creating a boxplot and density plot of `wtdiff` for each level of `gender`. 
```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(x=wtdiff, col=gender)) + geom_density() + theme_bw()
ggplot(cdc, aes(y=wtdiff, x=gender, fill=gender)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()
```
Looks like pretty similar distributions. 

2. Use `t.test()` function with **model notation: y ~ x**. 
```{r}
t.test(wtdiff~gender, data=cdc)
```

On average, males want to loose 10.8 lbs whereas females want to loose 18.2 lbs. We are 95% confident that females on average want to loose 6.7 to 8.0 more lbs compared to males. 


### Two sample Z-test for a difference in proportions

**Does a higher proportion of males smoke than females?**

1. Look at the data. 
```{r}
addmargins(table(cdc$smoke100, cdc$gender))
prop.table(table(cdc$smoke100, cdc$gender), margin=2)
```

42% of females smoke compared to 52% of males. 

2. Since `smoke100` is 0/1 numeric, we can still use `t.test()` with model notation. 
```{r}
t.test(smoke100 ~ gender, data=cdc)
```

We could also use `prop.test()` with the frequency table numbers above. 
```{r}
prop.test(x=c(4419, 5021), n=c(10431, 9567))
```


### ANOVA

**Does the desired weight differ across different general health reporting categories?**

1. Look at the data. Side by side boxplots with overlay violin plots are great here. 
```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(y=wtdesire, x=genhlth, fill=genhlth)) + geom_boxplot() + 
        theme_bw() + 
        stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", pch=17, geom="point",  size = 2) + # adds the mean as a diamond
        scale_fill_discrete(guide=FALSE) # get rid of the legend created by the fill= argument
```

2. Conduct an ANOVA

```{r}
model <- aov(wtdesire~genhlth, data=cdc) #aov() is the workhorse function
summary(model) # prints it in an easy to ready fashion. 
```

At least one group has a different average desired weight (p<.0003). 

3. Follow-up with finding out which pairs of groups are different. 

```{r}
TukeyHSD(model)
```

The only two groups whose averages differ significantly from each other are: 

* those reporting to be in good health want to loose on average 2.63 (0.93, 4.34) lbs more than those who report being in excellent health (p=.0002). 
* those reporting to be in very good health want to loose 2.1 (0.5, 3.7) lbs more than those who report being in excellent health (p=.0045)


### Chi-Squared test of
* Association
* Independence
* Goodness of fit
* Equal proportions

### Linear Regression and Correlation

**Is there a linear relationship between how much a person weighs and their desired weight?**

1. Guess what. Yea. Look at your data. 
```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(x=weight, y=wtdesire)) + 
      geom_point(size=.5) + # lots of points so i'm shrinking the size of the point
      geom_smooth(se=FALSE, col="red") + # adds a smoothing trend line
      geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="lm", col="blue") + # adds a best fit line
      theme_bw()
```

A linear model may not be appropriate for those who weigh over 250-300 lbs. 

2. Fit a linear regression line for those who weigh less than 250 lbs. 
The workhorse function here is `lm()`, but like `aov()` looks better after being wrapped in a `summary()`. 

```{r}
lt250 <- subset(cdc, weight<=250)

linear.model <- lm(wtdesire ~ weight, data=lt250)
summary(linear.model)
```

The linear regression equation is $$y = 35.4 + .71x$$. 

The amount of weight someone wants to loose significantly increases by 0.71 lbs for ever additional pound they weigh. 

Calculate the simple correlation between actual and desired weight. 
```{r}
cor(lt250$wtdesire, lt250$weight)
```

### Multple Linear Regression
You can add multiple predictors to any regression model by adding the variable names using a `+`. 

**How does gender affect the relationship between how much a person weighs and their desired weight?**

1. Guess what. Yea. Look at your data. 
```{r}
ggplot(cdc, aes(x=weight, y=wtdesire, col=gender)) + 
      geom_point(size=.5) + 
      geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + # adds a smoothing trend line - per group
      theme_bw()
```

2. Fit the additive linear model of weight + gender

```{r}
summary(lm(wtdesire ~ weight + gender, data=lt250))
```

Note the coefficient for gender: `genderm`. R appends the factor level that it is modeling to the end of the variable name, so `gender**m**` means the effect of being male on the relationship between actual and desired weight compared to the reference group (females). 

What about an interaction? Does gender _change_ the relationship between actual and desired weight?  Interaction terms are added using a `*`. 

```{r}
summary(lm(wtdesire ~ weight + gender + weight*gender, data=lt250))
```

The interaction term is significant.
